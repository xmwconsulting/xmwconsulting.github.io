    <a href="/contact">contact</a> us to discuss your requirements. </p>   
<p> Examples of successful projects completed by XMW Consulting include: </p>   
<p class="serviceexample"> Implemented a promotional forecasting system for a very large 
    UK supermarket, meeting target of a <strong><em>&pound;10M annual reduction in waste
    </em></strong> and improved availability. This system is fully implemented in MATLAB, 
    is integrated with a data warehouse system, and has been in production making live, 
    daily promotional forecasts across all food categories with zero unplanned downtime 
    for over a year. </p>   
<p style="text-align:right"> <a href="/recommendations/index.html#duncan_apthorp_quote">&raquo; read recommendation</a> </p>   
<p class="serviceexample"> Developed applications for the analysis, visualisation and 
    simulation of geophysical and seismological data for a very large UK oil and gas 
    company, enabling a <strong><em>game-changing reduction in analysis time</em></strong> 
    from over two weeks to less than one day. These applications include complex 
    graphical user interfaces, multicore and HPC parallel computing, and integration of 
    C code with MATLAB. </p>   
<p style="text-align:right"> <a href="/recommendations/index.html#pat_connolly_quote">&raquo; read recommendation</a> </p>   
<p class="serviceexample"> Developed, and released to production, applications for a 
    large Switzerland-based investment bank to aggregate, analyze and visualize very 
    large numbers of balance sheet calculations. This project included a strong 
    requirement for robust, production-strength software development, build and release 
    processes. </p>   
<p class="serviceexample"> Built a statistical model to predict domestic UK property 
    valuations for a web-based real estate company, leading to a <strong><em>40% 
    improvement in prediction accuracy</em></strong>. This project included a focus on 
    effective communication of analyses and results with entirely non-technical 
    clients. </p>   
<p class="serviceexample"> Reviewed, documented, and updated statistical models 
    underlying a pharmaceutical toxicity test for a Singapore-based biotech company, 
    <strong><em>helping to keep this small company in existence</em></strong> 
    following the sudden removal from sale of the cell lines used for the test. </p>   
<p class="serviceexample"> Audited for quality and compliance a collection of 
    technical MATLAB code for the calibration of magnetometers, as part of the due 
    diligence process of a Switzerland-based venture capital company considering an 
    investment in a manufacturer of drones for geophysical surveys. </p>
