Based in Cambridge, UK, XMW Consulting provides services to clients 
worldwide. Please [contact][1] us to discuss your requirements.

Examples of successful projects completed by XMW Consulting include:

{:.service-example}
Implemented a promotional forecasting system for a very large UK 
supermarket, meeting target of a ***&pound;10M annual reduction 
in waste*** and improved availability. This system is fully implemented 
in MATLAB, is integrated with a data warehouse system, and has been in 
production making live, daily promotional forecasts across all food 
categories with zero unplanned downtime for over a year.

{:.service-example}
Developed applications for the analysis, visualisation and simulation of 
geophysical and seismological data for a very large UK oil and gas company, 
enabling a ***game-changing reduction in analysis time*** from over two 
weeks to less than one day. These applications include complex graphical 
user interfaces, multicore and HPC parallel computing, and integration of C 
code with MATLAB.

{:.service-example} 
Developed, and released to production, applications for a large 
Switzerland-based investment bank to aggregate, analyze and visualize very 
large numbers of balance sheet calculations. This project included a strong 
requirement for robust, production-strength software development, build and 
release processes.

{:.service-example} 
Built a statistical model to predict domestic UK property valuations for a 
web-based real estate company, leading to a ***40% improvement in 
prediction accuracy***. This project included a focus on effective 
communication of analyses and results with entirely non-technical clients.

{:.service-example} 
Reviewed, documented, and updated statistical models underlying a 
pharmaceutical toxicity test for a Singapore-based biotech company, 
***helping to keep this small company in existence*** following the sudden 
removal from sale of the cell lines used for the test.

{:.service-example} 
Audited for quality and compliance a collection of technical MATLAB code 
for the calibration of magnetometers, as part of the due diligence process 
of a Switzerland-based venture capital company considering an investment in 
a manufacturer of drones for geophysical surveys.
