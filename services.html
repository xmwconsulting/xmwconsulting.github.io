                <p class="serviceexample"> Implemented a promotional forecasting system for a very large 
                    UK supermarket, meeting target of a <strong><em>&pound;10M annual reduction in waste
                    </em></strong> and improved availability. This system is fully implemented in MATLAB, 
                    is integrated with a data warehouse system, and has been in production making live, 
                    daily promotional forecasts across all food categories with zero unplanned downtime 
                    for over a year. </p>

                <p class="serviceexample"> Developed applications for the analysis, visualisation and 
                    simulation of geophysical and seismological data for a very large UK oil and gas 
                    company, enabling a <strong><em>game-changing reduction in analysis time</em></strong> 
                    from over two weeks to less than one day. These applications include complex 
                    graphical user interfaces, multicore and HPC parallel computing, and integration of 
                    C code with MATLAB. </p>

                <p class="serviceexample"> Developed, and released to production, applications for a 
                    large Switzerland-based investment bank to aggregate, analyze and visualize very 
                    large numbers of balance sheet calculations. This project included a strong 
                    requirement for robust, production-strength software development, build and release 
                    processes. </p>   
                <p class="serviceexample"> Built a statistical model to predict domestic UK property 
                    valuations for a web-based real estate company, leading to a <strong><em>40% 
                    improvement in prediction accuracy</em></strong>. This project included a focus on 
                    effective communication of analyses and results with entirely non-technical 
                    clients. </p>   
                <p class="serviceexample"> Reviewed, documented, and updated statistical models 
                    underlying a pharmaceutical toxicity test for a Singapore-based biotech company, 
                    <strong><em>helping to keep this small company in existence</em></strong> 
                    following the sudden removal from sale of the cell lines used for the test. </p>   
                <p class="serviceexample"> Audited for quality and compliance a collection of 
                    technical MATLAB code for the calibration of magnetometers, as part of the due
