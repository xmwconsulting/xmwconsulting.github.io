XMW Consulting provides services in the areas of data science, statistical 
analysis and software engineering, specializing in the development of 
production-strength applications with [MATLAB][1]

Its founder, Sam Roberts, has over seventeen years of experience (including 
seven as a consultant at [MathWorks][2], makers of MATLAB) applying these 
methods to help a [wide range of clients][3] from the pharmaceutical, 
energy, finance, aerospace, Formula 1, food, consumer goods, petrochemical 
and retail sectors.

The long-term trend toward availability of large-scale computational power 
has enabled industries such as these to collect an exponentially increasing 
amount of data; but clear analysis, visualization, interpretation and 
communication remain as challenging as they have ever been.  

In addition, algorithms and models &mdash; however accurate &mdash; are of 
no value if they cannot be deployed and integrated into production within 
the constraints imposed by business and IT realities: scalability, 
usability, availability, reliability, performance, auditability &mdash; 
and of course, cost.

The [services][4] offered by XMW Consulting aim to guide the client through 
the maze of possibilities &mdash; providing clear, comprehensible advice 
to cut through the confusion.
