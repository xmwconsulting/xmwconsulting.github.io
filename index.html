<p> XMW Consulting provides services in the areas of data science, statistical analysis and software engineering, 
    specializing in the development of production-strength applications with 
    <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab">MATLAB</a>. </p>   
<p> Its founder, Sam Roberts, has over seventeen years of experience (including seven as a consultant at 
    <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</a>, makers of MATLAB) applying these methods to help a 
    <a href="/recommendations">wide range of clients</a> from the pharmaceutical, energy, finance, aerospace, 
    Formula 1, food, consumer goods, petrochemical and retail sectors. </p>   
<p> The long-term trend toward availability of large-scale computational power has enabled industries such as 
    these to collect an exponentially increasing amount of data; but clear analysis, visualization, 
    interpretation and communication remain as challenging as they have ever been. </p>     
<p> In addition, algorithms and models &mdash; however accurate &mdash; are of no value if they cannot be deployed 
    and integrated into production within the constraints imposed by business and IT realities: scalability, 
    usability, availability, reliability, performance, auditability &mdash; and of course, cost. </p>   
<p> The <a href="/services">services</a> offered by XMW Consulting aim to guide the client through the maze 
    of possibilities &mdash; providing clear, comprehensible advice to cut through the confusion. </p>   
<p class="highlight"> From data to interpretable, actionable understanding </p>   
<p class="highlight"> From algorithms to robust, production-strength applications </p>
